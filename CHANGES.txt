- BREAKING CHANGE: pyramid_ldap now depends on python-ldap >= 3.0, which
  supports python 2 and 3. If you upgrade pyramid_ldap without upgrading
  python-ldap, you will see failures where python-ldap receives text arguments
  instead of bytes. See below for more information.

- python-ldap >= 3.0 began stopped accepting `bytes` type arguments for many
  `LDAPObject` methods. We now use the `pyramid.compat.text_` function to
  support text arguments for python 2 and 3.
